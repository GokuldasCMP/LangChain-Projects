       "Document(metadata={'source': 'interview.txt'}, page_content=\"\\nHello, everyone. This is Kiran. Today, we have with us, and today's mock intro will be on Python. So Python is booming these days. Many people are doing Python course, and many opportunities we have, for job in Python.\\n\\nShe's one of the example of workplace. She is MSC physics. BSC physics. Right? Yes, sir.\\n\\nSo, Puri, welcome, and let's start the interview. But, really, when I saw your resume and your non IT, I would say not non IT, but it's pure non IT. Pure non IT. Yeah. It's nowhere related.\\n\\nSo it's a BSC physics MSC. So but great. So who told you to do the this Python? Who told you to say how you got encouraged, first of all? This is the basic question every audience will need because you are no related.\\n\\nNow Yes. MSC physics person can do Python means. MSC math person also can do. Right? So who told you to do that?\\n\\nSo Or how you got inspired? Initially, my plan was to enter in the research field. It is still my plan. It's just secondary. But, after surveying the market, I got to know that research field is not, as much high paying until you have cracked a few milestones in your career.\\n\\nAnd to do that, I still have around three to four years' time. So till then, to support myself financially, I decided to have a backup plan. And as we know, currently, IT industry and even in that Python is very much related to physics. So then I chose Python language as my So you mean to say IT has money? And IT has various types, Java, Python, Mono, many thing.\\n\\nAnd out of that, you selected Python. Python. Yeah. Great. So let's start some questions.\\n\\nYes. So how much you rate, you're already working right now. Right? Three week before you joined some organization. That's great.\\n\\nSo my question is, like, how much you rate yourself in core Python out of one to 10? 10 is highest one is least. I'll go for eight, sir. We'll go for eight? Yes.\\n\\nIn a sense? Just a second. You go for eight. Good. Django?\\n\\nDjango, a nine. Out of ten nine? Yes. Good. Good confidence to have it.\\n\\nOkay. So let's start with the core Python. Python is platform independent or not? Yes, sir. It is.\\n\\nIt is. Yes. Okay. Why Python, we are saying, as an interpreted language? So because in Python, the code is run line by line.\\n\\nSo if we have error in some line, the, compiling and all the running is done after the line until we encounter the error. Unlike in compiled languages, the whole code is first compiled, converted. We have to, get rid of the errors, and then it is done. So for Python, the execution is line by line, and, hence, it is, called as an interpreted language. Okay.\\n\\nGreat. Next is, like, what is PIP? PIP is Python it's like an installer package for Python. Because Python has a very vast community, we cannot download all Python's functionalities in one loop. So if we need to download some other external packages, libraries, or frameworks, we make use of PIP for that.\\n\\nMhmm. Did you use that? Yes, sir. Or what do you have used? I have used it to, install Django MySQL client, which is used for database connection, basically.\\n\\nWhich package you have installed for database connection? MySQL client. Okay. Okay. Through peep?\\n\\nPeep. Yes. So you need to fire that command and automatically it will come. Right? Yeah.\\n\\nSo where from it is coming? Like, Python installed. So It installs from the website. It's On web. Yeah.\\n\\nSo in web, you mean to say a lot of things are there? Lot of libraries? There are a lot of libraries associated with Any other library you know than MySQL? I know Django framework. Mhmm.\\n\\nThen there's Flask framework. Mhmm. MySQL is there. Then we have other course headers, which is used for API connections. That also we have to download externally.\\n\\nI guess that's also. Scrapping, you know, web snapping? I'm not aware of that, sir. Right? Great.\\n\\nNot a problem. So there's many things you can download from the web and install. Right? Great. Do you know, like, you know, collection?\\n\\nYes, sir. Yeah. What do you know in that? Generalized terms. Collection is, it's like a collection of a group of elements.\\n\\nAnd in Python, we have a few collective data types, which are list, tuple, set, dictionary. So these are basically multiple data points that have been collected and stored together. Tuple, you cannot change. Right? No.\\n\\nTuple is immutable. Why do you use it? Sir, if I Say something is there and Yeah. You need to change it. Right?\\n\\nYes. But, then why why tuple? Can you give me some examples so that tuple will be used? The thing is for, list, the memory takes us more, and so the speed of execution is less. So if we have the kind of data that does not have to be changed, but you need a high performance with it and higher speed with it, then we can make use of tuple because tuple, of course, very good memory management as compared to other collected data types.\\n\\nSo for memory management, you should be going with the tuple. Yeah. And if you want to change it, then go for? List. We can.\\n\\nCan you convert tuple to list? Yes, sir. And list to tuple? Yeah. By type custom, we can.\\n\\nBy type custom? Can we pass that list object into tuple constructor? Yeah. We can. We can?\\n\\nYes, sir. Great. Okay. So you know partners? Not as much.\\n\\nYou heard about it? Yeah. I know that it is used for, sorting data when we have big data collections. It is used to clean the data for, stat statistical uses. So I can say cleaning the data is a use of pandas or showing some metrics forms is a use of pandas?\\n\\nI'm not aware of it as well. So you have not used, but you heard about it. I have. Did you ever practice any single program on it? I'm not gonna ask, so don't worry about it.\\n\\nBut did you ever tried any program on pandas? No. I haven't worked on pandas. Yeah. So what I would suggest you because, anyway, you're working.\\n\\nYou've already got placement. You're working in some broad nation. It's really good. But, nevertheless, what I would say, always do some programs on NumPy, Panda, because that is the future. Yeah.\\n\\nIt's not about you should be expert in that, but, do some programs. I know it's not needed for you, for your profile maybe. Your profile what's your profile in your company? It's web development. Python developer.\\n\\nSo Django you might be using? Yeah. API development to be specific. So I'm API development you're using. So which framework you're using?\\n\\nDjango. Django is framework. Yeah. Why to create APIs? So, APIs are used for communication between two applications.\\n\\nWhy to communicate? If I have a front end and I have a database system on the back end. Can I just close this? Yeah. Yeah.\\n\\nWord. A database system on the back end. So, API is used to fetch the data from the back end and pass it on to the front end. But while doing so, it uses the concepts like serialization, and it also keeps data private so that the front end does not have all the access to the back ends. This is just what I am doing in the company.\\n\\nBut in general also, communicating between two applications, it provides, serialization of data, which is a better way of passing the data between two applications and also provides privacy to both of them. So you want to say API should be developed or REST API should be developed to communicate between two systems. Right? Yes. This is one system.\\n\\nThis is one system. To communicate between systems, go for REST API. Yes. This system is developed in dot net, and this system is developed in Python. Yeah.\\n\\nWill they be able to communicate? I'm not aware of it. Yes. Basically, use of API REST API is communicating with with two application, as you said, is correct. But most of the cases, what happens, now let's say weather application is there.\\n\\nWe don't know in which language it has been developed. Right? Yeah. So it might be dot net. It might be PHP.\\n\\nI am a Python developer. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna call that API of that weather application. And I will not mind whether there is developing which language because I am aware about JSON. Yes. I am aware about consuming an API.\\n\\nThat whether person has exposed API, produced APIs. So I would be a consumer, and that person will be producer. So you got the concept? Yes. But that's great that you'll learn more many things as you go on Yeah.\\n\\nDoing things in your company. You're happy with the automation? Yes, sir. I am. Great.\\n\\nI'm still learning. I think they gave you today leave or maybe break for this mock interviews. Right? So I heard that. Okay.\\n\\nSo REST API. Right? Yes. This is REST's protocol. Yeah.\\n\\nCorrect? Do you know any other protocol is available for creating an API? No. I'm not available. So Okay.\\n\\nYeah. So But, these days, everybody is using REST API. Okay? So More popular. It's more popular.\\n\\nYou know JSON? Yeah. What is it? It's just a way of, storing information, which is which has a very good resemblance to dictionaries in Python. It's keyword and value pairings.\\n\\nSo just I remember, like, dictionary as you're saying. Can you have list in dictionary? If we provide it with the key, we can have a dictionary. Can we duplicate values in dictionary? Yes.\\n\\nWe can. Not keys. Right? No. Keys cannot be duplicate.\\n\\nCan we add two dictionaries? Add two dictionaries. Will they concatenate like each? I think we should be able to. If we put the plus operator, they might concatenate.\\n\\nBut I'm I haven't tried it yet, but I think they will. Those who are listening this mock interview, can you write and comment whether two dictionaries can be concatenated? She already told us about the list. Right? And that was correct.\\n\\nSo I'm with you on that. But on the list, let people decide. So I was talking about the dictionary. Yes. So as people are deciding, we'll move ahead for the next question.\\n\\nHow do you train dictionary? We have three methods for it, dot keys, which iterates the keys. Dot keys or keys? Keys. Because it's a method, so I put a dot.\\n\\nSo keys, which iterates the keys, values, which will iterate the values, and the items which will iterate tuples of keys and values. Tuples of? Keys and values. Why you're saying tuples of key and values? Because it is comma separated key and value, which is enclosed in a tuple, singularly first, second, third.\\n\\nThat is comma separated and enclosed in a list. What's the role of SQL in Python? SQL is used for interacting with the database. So Okay. As I'm doing APIs, I have to interact with the database for which I use SQL.\\n\\nAre you interacting with database? Why can't you consume APIs directly? We have information stored in the database. So if we want to fetch that information specifically Through API? Yeah.\\n\\nSo you're writing APIs or consuming APIs? I'm writing APIs. I'm not consuming. Oh, great. So you are at the producer side?\\n\\nYeah. Not consumer side? Right. So that time, obviously, you are interacting with the Database. Database.\\n\\nWhich database you are using? MySQL. Why MySQL? Why not Oracle? I'm not aware of the Great.\\n\\nNo problem. That company decides. Yeah. But always remember, if you have huge data, you'll go with the Oracle. Okay?\\n\\nYeah. Which domain you're working into? Python. No. Not Python.\\n\\nCompany domain like trading, banking. Oh, it is raw material manufacturing. Okay. Great. Not a problem.\\n\\nSo you are calling SQL queries? Yeah. That's ORM tool you are using or what? Object Relational Map. Explain me ORM is what?\\n\\nLike? ORM stands for object relational mapping. So with SQL, we can interact with the database. We can manipulate data. Similarly, in Python, we have ORM, which is a tool with which we, interact with the data.\\n\\nWe can, extract data from it, add, update, delete. We can perform all these functions. Okay. So what do you think in industry, database has been created first or models will be created first? Logically, I think database should be created first.\\n\\nBecause that has been developed by developers or database administrators? Database administrators. Perfect. Then that is for, again, audience. Like, how to generate model file from the database.\\n\\nThose who are listening and doing Python, Django, I would ask them, like, how to generate model file from database. So so I would suggest, like, that command should be there. Yeah. Right? Or manually, you can do.\\n\\nManually also, we can do. So which command? Now you tell me. It's PYManageDotPYInspectDB. And, once we run that command, if we have a ready made database, the models will be created in our, Django framework.\\n\\nSo it is Why might be it is recommended in organizations don't modify the model? Means, once it is generated by that command, don't go and touch it. So because the database and the information in it is specific to the company, we cannot tamper with that information. We have to just do the work of displaying it. So it's like modifying the company's information.\\n\\nSo we are not allowed to do that. Okay. I have one more suggestion in that because white is not allowed it's not about tempering. It's about that, but not much, of it. But it maintains the standard.\\n\\nOkay. So you are working on REST API. So I have one more question. Like, is there any role of HTML CSS in your project? Right now, I'm working on React.\\n\\nSo You're working on React. So React development, you started already or not? Not yet. I am in the learning phase. So my question is while creating REST API, you need to use HTML CSS.\\n\\nYes or no? No. Perfect. That was my question. Because that's just the back end.\\n\\nYeah. It's not a front end. When you want to expose the data on the front end, then you will be using React. Correct? Yeah.\\n\\nYes. That's great. So my next question will be, what is this Jinja template? Jinja template is a way of, writing the information in HTML pages. So, HTML pages are not dynamic.\\n\\nIt's it's not like JavaScript. You cannot, write logic on it. But with the use of Jinja template, which is, again, a functionality provided by Django, with the help of that, we can program logic on the HTML page itself. If you don't use this then? We cannot do any.\\n\\nWith Jinja template, we have things like if else. We have for loops. But purely HTML does not give us if else or for loops. So you mean to say in the template file Yeah. If you want to use, this code, what you call, core Python Python code Yes.\\n\\nAlong with HTML, then you need Jinja? Yeah. We do. Is there anything other than Jinja available? I'm not aware of this.\\n\\nYou're not aware of it. But, anyway, you are working on, rest, but still I have asked. What is MBT? MBT, it is the architecture on which Django works. So MBT stands for model, use, and templates.\\n\\nIn models, we have the structuring of our database. Mhmm. In views, we write the business logic of, fetching or adding or deleting data. And in templates, we write the HTML code. Okay.\\n\\nSo did you ever done any practice in Django? Yes, sir. I have. So can you show me any project which you have right now in your laptop? I have a project on my laptop.\\n\\nI think I Yeah. So please share your screen. Just I want to see whether, you practiced much or not. See, guys, those who are seeing this interview, I can say people will face any kind of questions. Okay?\\n\\nThere is no limit for it. Just I want to see and I want to ask some questions to you on that. So those who are seeing this interview, one more thing you should remember, sometimes it may happen that interim may ask you to show your screen, show your projects, which you have developed because you want to ask some questions on that. Okay? So be ready for that.\\n\\nLet's see how could we use our please share. Okay. You don't have permission? Yeah. You have.\\n\\nYeah. I have. Okay. So this is your project, the student management system you have done? Yes, sir.\\n\\nOkay. So can I see that in Visual Studio? Just a minute. We have to first activate the environment. Okay.\\n\\nThen I'm changing the directory to my project folder. You shared complete screen? No. I think I just shared one. Shared one before.\\n\\nI was just doing that. Okay. So what you did here, you opened a command prompt and then you are changing a screen. Right? Yeah.\\n\\nI have it. Go ahead. Mhmm. I'll now open the b s code. Mhmm.\\n\\nGreat. It will take a minute. Okay. Till that, why you use Versus Code? Any other competitors you know for Versus Code?\\n\\nI would not say competitor, but any other tools available in market. We have PyCharm also. Yeah. PyCharm. But, I I prefer v s four more.\\n\\nMhmm. Can you maximize the screen? Yeah. Just a minute. I'm not sure how to move this map map part of the.\\n\\nGreat. Okay. So I'm not asking you to run. Don't worry about that. And I did Yeah.\\n\\nBut, again, running because you did this coding and you're working also so, I have confidence that you'll be running that program. But I have some question. What is this post? Post is a method that is That is line number 18 I'm asking. Post is a method?\\n\\nPost over here. Yeah. So the post over here, it helps us to, send the data to our database. So when we are adding data to our database, we use post. And here in line number 18, student ID is being added back to the database.\\n\\nOkay. What is the render function? Render helps us to showcase this HTML page onto our, browser. So this is my HTML page in which I have written my form for, getting information from the user. Mhmm.\\n\\nThat page will be rendered onto my browser, my first page, and it will going it is going to fetch this information of student ID, name, city. And with the help of this post, it will put that information to the database. Okay. Great. So this registration is, function, which is posting data to the database.\\n\\nRight? Yes. Next, what is record function is doing? A record, sir. Print this slide.\\n\\nNo. No. It's not a it's my user defined function. Mhmm. So this function is going to, here I have fetched all the objects from the database.\\n\\nAnd with the help of this context function, I'm sending this to my HTML page for displaying. What is this objects all? Objects dot all? It is because this is basically ORM syntax. In ORM, when we are interacting with the database, that is done, in the form of objects.\\n\\nSo for ORM, when we fetch information from database, one single record is going to be as a single dictionary, which is an object in Python. And so we have to use objects. And after that, I'm using all because I want all the data from my database. If I had one is there anything, in the all function? Yes.\\n\\nThere is a get function. So with the help of that, we can fetch specific information about the specific student. So, like, for updating, when we click on a form, we click on the update button, we get already some information about the student, which we then update. So if you want that one specific information, we will make use of get. Okay.\\n\\nInstead of post, any other word you can write? Line number 18. Okay. Sure. Mhmm.\\n\\nOr it is compulsory that we need to write post post? It is compulsory to write post when we are adding for new information. It is mandatory. But in case we are updating, we can also use batch and put methods. You mean to say if I write there put, data will not get inserted?\\n\\nIt will. What if you guys don't those who are listening this video, instead of post, if I write p u t, will it post or not? It will put, but that will not be a good practice to do that, sir. It's just a practice you are saying. Yeah.\\n\\nBut you can do that? I think it will put If you write g t gate then? No. It will not put data then. It will get data from the database.\\n\\nYes, sir. But yeah. But how automatically it will get identified if you write gate means what I'm saying instead of post, if you write gate. You got my question? Yes, sir.\\n\\nP o s t, that is radical of what? If you write gate, you are saying data will not get posted. Right? No. How?\\n\\nMiss who's doing all these things? This get post put patch delete. But you are saying input, it will not update, but it will insert. Right? It will insert.\\n\\nYeah. But why not in case of gate? Because get is used for getting data from the database. It is used for fetching data, and it is not used for putting data over there. Really?\\n\\nYes, sir. So if you read gate, you mean to say it is not getting inserted. Right? No. It will not get inserted.\\n\\nYeah. What do you guys think? Please write down. Okay. So just moving ahead, can you show me the HTML page?\\n\\nRegistration.HTML? Where is the Jinja code? This first line is Jinja template. This Why you wrote extends? This file, master dot HTML, it has all my CSS.\\n\\nSo when we have common properties that we want to apply to all our pages, we, put it in a single file. And I have used extends to this is kind of importing the file onto this page. So it will apply all the CSS that I have done in master's file to my registration.HTML. Who taught you Python? WebOps.\\n\\nWebOps. WebOps. Great. He taught, you in a good manner or you read in a good manner? No, sir.\\n\\nHe taught me in a really good manner. But what I think, that is his duty and he is performing very well. But it's duty of candidates also to respond to what teacher is teaching. And you I think you greatly done that. You did best job.\\n\\nOkay. So you practiced and all that stuff. And then before placement, you need to give interviews. Right? Yeah.\\n\\nSo, yes, this is a two way, but your role is more important than Wigosa role. Okay. But, anyway, now coming to what is that static folder? Static folder. This is used to store CSS, images, JavaScript, and video files.\\n\\nSo we store it in this, and then whenever we need these files on our HTML page, we will import it from here. Okay. If you and, can we change that path of static folder? No, sir. We cannot do that.\\n\\nAnd it has to also be named static compulsorily because that is the way this architecture works. If we do not follow the naming convention, it will not identify the folder. Okay. Do we need to mention the static folder part in the setting dot p y? No.\\n\\nWe don't have to mention it, explicitly on our sites. It must be done there already. Okay. Just a second. Can you give me access of your screen?\\n\\nYes, sir. So how am I supposed to do that? I haven't done just a second. You and I don't know that. But let me check.\\n\\nShould I stop share? No. I'm sorry. Mhmm. Mhmm.\\n\\nYou and I don't know that. That's okay. Next question is, what is this migrations folder? In migrations folder, here, we have the layout of our table. So over here, this is, like, the layout of our table.\\n\\nWhat happens in Django is we have to collect to the database for which we write our columns in models dot t y. And when we run the make migrations command, it will make a table for us. That table is this what we see and the basic information about our columns, which is, integer field, character field, its data types. What is that? Where is it?\\n\\nOkay. I'm not aware of it, sir. Don't you think it's it might be related to cache or something? It is. But I'm I'm Oh, you're not aware?\\n\\nWhat is that init dot p y? Init dot p y, it is because this is a package, and each package has init dot p y. So that's why we see. Then only we can say the package is valid. Okay.\\n\\nOkay. So Django, can you open settings dot p y? Yeah. What's the use of URLs dot p y? In URLs.py, we write the URLs that through which we access our HTML or front end pages.\\n\\nOkay. So you have created Django project, let's say. Yes. There are further some steps to do that, and you created a Python project. What are the folder structure or what are the things you get freely?\\n\\nI'm not understanding. Let's say you created a Django project. Okay. How to create that project? For that, we have to first set up an environment.\\n\\nSo we do that. We install EMP with the help of p PIP, the PIP tool, and we set up the environment. This is done because we have to download additional, functionalities in it, and it's not wise to have that on our system. So setting dot p y file, you create by writing setting dot p y or it create get created automatically? It is created automatically.\\n\\nSo like that, what are the things you get automatically? That is one of my question. There's URLs dot p y Mhmm. In which we write URLs. Settings dot p y Mhmm.\\n\\nWhich has the back end connections. There is models dot p y, views dot p y, templates dot p y. There's also I think these are the main ones that we work in, but there are additional thing, like, even admin dot p y. Yeah. Great.\\n\\nOkay. So that's all about, the Django. Let me go ahead with something else. So I don't think we need system now because a lot of lot of things I have asked you already. Just a second.\\n\\nYeah. So you can close the laptop. I have some few questions for you. Yeah. Can we merge multiple list in Python?\\n\\nYes, sir. We can? Yeah. How? There is this, function by name of extends.\\n\\nIt's a method. It's not function. And by that, we can merge two different lists in fact. Do you know jeep method? Yeah.\\n\\nBy zip method, we can, merge multiple iteratives. The same index number elements are mapped together. Mhmm. Mhmm. Okay.\\n\\nLet's say if I ask you use the lambda function to print even numbers between one to hundred. How you'll do that? One to hundred, even numbers you want. Okay. More of entry we'll be using.\\n\\nBy the lambda function, can you just think of anything you want? We can use filter function with it, sir. Perfect. So for filter function, we will provide the lambda function. Mhmm.\\n\\nWe can provide a sequence. And in lambda function, we will give the expression, with mode, and that will give us a list of even numbers. Okay. So I have very few questions like why tuple is faster than list? Sir, because in list, if you see if you get two different lists with the same exact elements, it is going to take the lists are going to take different memory positions and also the individual elements.\\n\\nEven though they are same, they're also going to occupy different memory positions. But in tuple, the original tuple is going to take different locations, but the elements inside it, if they are same, it doesn't occupy different, memory. And so it takes less memory for execution. What is the decorator in Python? Decorators are used for, adding additional functionalities to our existing functions.\\n\\nSo it will take a function as an input, add some functionality to it, and return the function back. Why do that? So if we have some function on which we cannot modify, it is already in build or maybe, the function is, for some reason, not allowed for us to modify, then we can use decorators for it. Okay. Did you ever tried that?\\n\\nYeah. Right now, I'm working on the APIs and so So there you are using that? Yeah. Actually, one function can behave differently with different decorators, you mean to say? Yeah.\\n\\nIt can. It can. Function base function is same. Let's say there is a addition method, addition function. You can do that for averaging or something.\\n\\nRight? We can make use of decorators to change its behavior. Great. Great. Great.\\n\\nSo I think your twenty twenty two pass out. Yes. Right. Great. So I have asked a lot of questions, and I'm very happy.\\n\\nAnd just to coming lastly, coming to your feedback is really good. I'm not remembering how many questions you didn't answer. Do you remember? Haven't been keeping a track of that, sir. You're not keeping track because it's very difficult to know how many questions you didn't answer because you answered everything, most of the things.\\n\\nSo that would be the answer. Right? Okay. So what designation you have there? Python developer, you're saying?\\n\\nYes. Python dev full stack Python developer. Yeah. So I wouldn't say, like, you are just a fresher because two weeks, two, three weeks only then after you're joining. P Joke College, that is for twelfth.\\n\\nYes, sir. Okay. So this is the end of your interview. My feedback would be explore more and more, explore NumPy, Pandas, that all things are needed. NumPy don't think, like, it is only needed for data scientist, or Pandas is need for only data scientist.\\n\\nIt can be used in your daily operations also while creating in Django while creating in REST APIs. Okay? SQL knowledge. Now what is primary key and foreign key? Primary key is used for, setting unique identifiers, like unique data for our database.\\n\\nAnd foreign key is used when we are trying to connect two different tables together. Why to connect? It can sometimes happen, sir, that two different databases cannot be merged into one. Like, in the company that I'm working, it's not allowed for us to tamper with the data. In that case, we can use foreign key, and we can merge them together.\\n\\nTo merge two tables, you to use foreign key, that means you'd or I can say, if you want to display on a single page multiple data, multiple, data of multiple tables, then you'll be going for For foreign keys. What specialty of, primary key? It is unique, and it is not null. It cannot So you can identify each row. Right?\\n\\nYes. Yeah. Great. So questions are endless. If I keep asking, it will be a whole day, and I know you have good knowledge.\\n\\nSo for those who are seeing this interview, it's a good thing to learn she's just a fresher. Even I would say she's not working. She's working but just now joined, so I would say she's not working. She's just a fresher graduate person. She's answering flawlessly, so I expect you all to do study in that manner so that you'll be answering each and every questions.\\n\\nSee, see, guys, questions are never tough. If you study, do hard work, they'll be always easy. Right? Yes. It's not tough if you do study.\\n\\nDo practice. That's it. So thank you everyone, those who are seeing this video, and thank you, Purvi, and thank you Yeah. For coming, taking time out for giving interview. Many people have already shown interest.\\n\\nSo we have started taking Python interviews also.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.
